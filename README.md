## Xdebug

Xdebug is disabled by default.

```yml
cli
...
  environment:
    ...
    - XDEBUG_ENABLED=1
    ...
```

## Codebase initialization (optional, experimental)

Instead of mounting an existing the codebase from the host's file system, the container can initialize the codebase 
from a git repo.

```yml
cli
...
  environment:
    ...
    - GIT_URL=<url of the git repo>
    - GIT_BRANCH=<git branch>
    - GIT_COMMIT=<specific commit hash, optional>
    ...
```

**Note**: This approach requires a valid SSH key to be available in `docksal-ssh-agent` to access private repos.

**Warning**: Experimental. Don't use unless you know what you are doing.  
Anything inside `/var/www` in the container will be destroyed during codebase initialization.  
If you have the hosts file system mounted as project_root (`/var/www`), then the entire project codebase on the host 
will be destroyed.
